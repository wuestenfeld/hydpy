HydPy Style Guide
_________________

Python allows for writing concise and easily readable software code,
that can be maintained and further developed with relative ease.
However, code quality does also depend on the experience (and available
time) of the programmer writing it.  In hydrology, much model code is
written by PhD students and other young scientists, who --- besides
having participated in some more or less comprehensive introductory
courses --- have often little programming experience and who are under
the pressure not only to get their model running, but also to tackle
their scientific questions and to publish as many research articles
as possible within a limited period of time.  The source code
resulting from such a rush is understandably often a mess.  And even
the better software results often prove inadequate when it comes
to transfering the software into practical applications or sharing it
with other researchers.

This is why we defined the HydPy Style Guide, which is a refinement
of `PEP 8`_ --- the "official" Style Guide for Python Code.
`PEP 8`_ gives coding conventions that help to write clear code.
And it eases diving into already existing source code, as one has
less effort with unraveling the mysteries of overly creative
programming solutions.  The HydPy Style Guide essentially adds two
requirements to `PEP 8`_: first, that the framework shall be
applicable for hydrologists with little or even no programming
experience, and secondly, that the common gap between model code,
model documentation and model testing shall be closed as well as
possible.  These two points are elucidated in the following two
subsections, in which we discuss the general framework style and
the model implementation style seperately.  If not stated otherwise,
the


General framework features
--------------------------
When trying to contribute code to the framework tools of HydPy (meaning
basically everything except the actual hydrological model implementations),
on has to be aware that even slight changes can have significant effects
on the applicability of HydPy, and that future HydPy developers must cope
with your contributions.   So, always make sure to check the effects of
your code changes properly (as desribed below).  And try to structure your
code in a readable, object-oriented design.  This section describes some
conventions for the development of HydPy, but is no guidance on how to write
good source code in general.  So, if you have little experience in programming
so far, first make sure to learn the basics of Python through some
`Python tutorials`_.  Afterwards, improve your  knowledge on code quality
through reading more advanced literature like this
`book on object-oriented design`_.

Python Version
..............
HydPy is written in (the latest version) of CPython 2.7.  So
change its source code or write new one that is compatible with
this Python version.  However, always insert::

    from __future__ import division, print_function

at the top of a new module.  This introduces the new (integer) division
and print statement of Python 3 into Python 2, reducing later efforts
to migrate HydPy to Python 3.  Any help to further increase the
compatibility of HydPys code base with Python 3 is welcome!

Site Packages
.............
Whenever reasonable, import only packages of the
`The Python Standard Library`_ or at least restrict yourself
to mature and stable site packages.  At the moment, HydPy relies
only on the highly accepted site packages `Cython`_, `NumPy`_,
and `matplotlib`_.  Further developments of HydPy based on more
specialized site packages (e.g. for plotting maps) might be
useful.  But the related import commands should be secured in
a way that allows for the application of HydPy without having
these specialized site packages available.

Imports
.......
As recommended in `PEP 8`_, clarify the sources of your imports.
Always use the following pattern at the top of a new module
(with some example packages)::

    # import from...
    # ...the Python Standard Library:
    from __future__ import division, print_function
    import os
    import sys
    # ...site-packages:
    import numpy (
    # ...from HydPy:
    from hydpy.core import sequencentools
    from hydpy.cythons import pointer

(Note that each import command has its own line.  Always import
complete modules from HydPy without changing their names. ---
No wildcard imports!)

Defensive Programming
.....................
HydPy is intended to be applicable by researchers and practitioners
who are no Python experts and may have little experience in programming
in general.  Hence it is desirable to anticipate errors due to misleading
input as good as possible and report them as soon as possible.
So, in contradiction to `PEP 8`_, it is
recommended to not just expose the names of simple public attributes.
Instead, use protected attributes (usually properties) to assure
that the internal states of objects remain consistent, whenever this
appears to be useful. One already implemented example is that it
is not allowed to assign an unknown string to the `outputfiletype`
of a `SequenceManager`::

    from hydpy import SequenceManager
    sm = SequenceManager()
    sm.outputfiletype = 'test'

Of course, the extensive usage of protected attributes increases
the length of the source code and slows computation time.  But,
regarding the first point, writing a graphical user interface
would require much more source code. And, regarding the second
point, the computation times of the general framework
functionalities discussed here should be negligible in comparison
with the computation times of the hydrological simulations,
which are discussed below, in the majority of cases.

Exceptions
..........
The unmodified error messages of Python (and of the imported
libraries) are often not helpful in the application of HydPy due
to two reasons: First, they are probably read by someone who has
no experience in understanding Pythons exception handling system.
And secondly, they do not tell in which context a problem occurs.
Here, "context" does not mean the relevant part of the source code,
which is of course referenced in the traceback; instead it means
things like the concerned geographical location.  It would, for example,
be of little help to only know that the required value of a certain
parameter is not available, when the same parameter is applied
thousands of times in different subcatchments.  Hence try to add
as much helpful information to error messages as possible, e.g.::

    raise RuntimeError('For parameter %s of element %s no value has been '
                       'defined so far.  Hence it is not possible to...'
                       % (parameter.name, objecttools.devicename(parameter)))

(The function :func:`~hydpy.core.objecttools.devicename` tries
to determine the name of the :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Node`
or :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Element` instance (indirectly)
containing the given object, which is in many cases the most relevant
information for identifying the error source.)

Use the following code block as a starting point to augment e.g.
standard Python error messages with `HydPy information`::

    try:
        do something
    except BaseException:
        exc, message, traceback_ = sys.exc_info()
        message = ('While trying to do something with element %s, '
                   'the following error occured:  %s'
                   % (element.name, message))
        raise exc, message, traceback_

Naming Conventions
..................
The naming conventions of `PEP 8`_ apply.  Additionally, it is
encouraged to name classes and their instances as similar as
possible whenever reasonable, often simply switching from
**CamelCase** to **lowercase**. This can be illustrated based
on some classes for handling time series:

=============== ============== ===================================================================================
Class Name      Instance Name  Note
=============== ============== ===================================================================================
Sequences       sequences      each Model instance handles exactly one Sequence instance: `model.sequences`
InputSequences  inputs         "inputsequences" would be redundant for attribute access: `model.sequences.inputs`
=============== ============== ===================================================================================

If possible, each instance itself should define its preferred name via
the property `name`::

	'inputs' = model.sequences.inputs.name

For classes like :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Element` or
:class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Node`, where names (and not
namespaces) are used to differentiate between instances, the
property `name` is also implemented, but --- of course --- not
related to the class name, e.g.::

    'gauge1' = Node('gauge1').name

In HydPy, instances of the same or similar type should be grouped in
collection objects with a similar name, but an attached letter "s".
Different :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Element` instances are stored
in an instance of the class :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Elements`,
different :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Node` instances are stored in
an instance of the class :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Nodes`...

Collection Classes
..................
The naming (of the instances) of collection classes is discussed just
above.  Additionally, try to follow the following recommendations.

Each collection object should be iterable.  Normally, both the names of
the handled objects (as known to the collection object) and the objects
themself should be returned, e.g.::

    for (name, node) in hp.nodes:
        ...

To ease working in the interactive mode, objects handled by a
collection object should be accessible as attributes::

    hp.nodes.gauge1
    hp.nodes.gauge2

Whenever usefull, define convenience functions which simplify the
handling of collection objects, e.g.::

    from hydpy import Node, Nodes
    nodes = Nodes()
    nodes += Node('gauge1')
    nodes.gauge1 is nodes['gauge1']
    print(len(nodes))
    print('gauge1' in nodes)
    print(nodes.gauge1 in nodes)
    newnodes = nodes.copy()
    print(nodes is newnodes)
    print(nodes.gauge1 is newnodes.gauge1)
    nodes -= 'gauge1'


String Representations
......................
A good string representation is one that a Non-Python-Programmer does
not identify to be a string representation.
