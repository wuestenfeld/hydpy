Model Collection
================

To work with a framework for hydrological modelling is all the more useful, 
the more models are implemented.  However, HydPy is not only intended to
allow for the flexible combination of different model concepts.  It tries
to contribute to the improvement of software quality and transparency in 
hydrological modelling.  Hence, each model shall be implemented in accordance 
with the HydPy-Styleguide. We decided to publish only those of our own
model implementations, which fullfill this requirement.

Models presently available:
